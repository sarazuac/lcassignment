# README

For the back end API I used Ruby on Rails. To be honest I never worked with Ruby or Rails before, but I think my experience with c# and .Net WebAPI helped me in creating the Rails API.

I know by default Rails likes to use SQLite, but I never worked with that technology before so I decided to go with something I am more familiar in MySql. 

I only used 2 controllers for this project - PeopleController to manage the GET of the list of people from MySql. FilterController to manage the GET and POST of the filters. 

I created this API as a separate project in order to use ReactJS in the front end.
